## The Big Picture

--

* You're embarking on an adventure. You'll experience highs and lows.

--

* You're here to _be_ a programmer. Start now. Writing code is your job.

--

* We're here to grow _together_. You're part of a community. Our community.

--

* Focus on process and problem solving over details.
  * Trying to memorize everything _will not_ give the best outcome!
  * Writing correct code is about being able to debug, not remember.

---

## A few things to know about Flatiron

--

### Timelines

* You're with us for 15 weeks, broken into 5 3-week mods.
  * One each on: Ruby, Rails, Javascript, React. Then final projects!
* Each mod has 2 weeks of class and an exam, followed by a project week.
  * During project week, you will be building an app of your design all day.

--

### The Purpose of Lecture

* What we type _isn't important_. What we're thinking about _is important_.

--

* Bringing a pen, paper, and whiteboard is as useful as a laptop.

--

* Lectures are recorded and code is uploaded. All will be accessible through learn.

--

* See the concepts beforehand so lecture time can focus on questions and nuances.

### What it takes to succeed

#### Failing

--

* [Listen to Julia][julia] Evans.

--

* You're going to hit walls. A lot.
  * (If you don't, this isn't the best use of your time.)

--

* You will spend more of your career reading and debugging code than writing it!
  * So see those things as important. Don't be discouraged by errors.

--

* When writing code, we're experimenting constantly. Run the code, not just the tests.
  * And we make tons of mistakes. It's great. Learn from mistakes.

---

### What it takes to succeed

#### Vulnerability

--

* You're taking a big chance. I love that.

--

* Let us know when you feel underchallenged or totally lost.
  * And by all means, help each other!
  * But root out misunderstandings, don't reveal answers.

--

* Ask me to explain things til I'm hoarse. Until _you_ are satisfied.

--

* Be careful about evaluating your progress _while in motion_.
  * It's natural to want to compare yourself to others. Instead, focus on building.

--

* Impostor syndrome is real. Know that I believe you _can_ be a programmer.
  * And there were plenty of times I wondered if I would "make it".

### What it takes to succeed

#### Curiosity

> Interviewer: Is studying computer science the best way to prepare to be a programmer?

> Bill Gates: No. The best way to prepare is to write programs and
> study programs others have written. ... You've got to want to be
> in this incredible feedback loop where you get people to tell you
> what you're doing wrong.

* Programmers at Work

--

Your goal _isn't_ the completion of this course. You won't get jobs because of a certificate.

--

Focus on your programming process, not "finishing" all the content.
  * Pay attention to phases of learning:
    * Reading code written by a professional. (easiest)
    * Being able to write working code while referencing examples. (next day)
    * Being able to write code without examples, just looking up occasional syntax. (next week)

---

## Some Expectations

--

* Get a full night's sleep. Get here on time.
* Be responsible adults. Pursue this seriously.
* Be respectful of each other's experiences.
* Enjoy programming with us. :)
